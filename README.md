# Lensophy - Respectful Communication
Based on philosophical principles of ethics and virtue, Lensophy acts as an observational lens, providing users with the opportunity to reconsider and rephrase messages that may contain verbal aggression before sending them.

# TL;DR;
If you prefer to understand through practice, go straight to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/raphaelmoreira/lensophy/tree/main/src/Lensophy/Doc#getting-started), otherwise, continue.

# How it works?

This API provides developers with the ability to enhance their comment systems (such as forums, blogs, or websites) by analyzing, filtering, and encouraging good behavior through suggested responses that guide towards a friendly perspective rather than censoring it.

### WARNING!
The example above is merely illustrative, acting as a suggestion for use. There are no interfaces or UX flow. This must be done by you. Lensophy just returns an object with suggested message, after analysis.

# Concept
The principles guiding the api consider "The Triple Filter" of Socrates, "The Right Speech" of Buddha and Confucius's "Trusted Disciple" approaches. You can read more about this in [The Philosophy](https://raphaelmoreira.github.io/lensophy/articles/philosophy.html).

# Why waste time on this?
Remind people that, even physically distant from the interlocutor, respect must be maintained. Check the [Sui Generis](https://raphaelmoreira.github.io/lensophy/articles/sui-generis.html), if you wanna read more about it.
