# Lensophy
Lensophy is a library designed to promote positive and respectful online communication. Based on philosophical principles of ethics and virtue, Lensophy acts as an observational lens, providing users with the opportunity to reconsider and rephrase messages that may contain verbal aggression before sending them.

# How it works?

This API provides developers with the ability to enhance their comment systems (such as forums, blogs, or websites) by analyzing, filtering, and encouraging good behavior through suggested responses that guide towards a friendly perspective rather than censoring it.

# Philosophy
The principles guiding the tool consider the following approaches:

## The Triple Filter of Socrates
This refers to an approach that assesses the validity of information and the words of others. It serves as a reminder that we should be critical of the information we encounter, seek the truth, promote goodness, and consider the utility of our words and beliefs. This philosophical approach remains relevant today for evaluating information and making informed decisions.

It is divided into three filters:

- <ins>Truth Filter</ins>: Before speaking or believing something, question whether it is true. Seek the truth and do not accept information without solid evidence.

- <ins>Goodness Filter</ins>: Consider whether what was about to be said or believed is good. Words and actions should be beneficial to all involved, promoting well-being and harmony.

- <ins>Usefulness Filter</ins>: Evaluate whether what was about to be said or believed is useful. Information should serve a constructive purpose and contribute to knowledge or progress.

## The "Right Speech" of Buddha
Part of the Noble Eightfold Path, it is one of the fundamental principles of Buddhism. It is one of the eight parts of this path and represents the importance of practicing honest, truthful, and benevolent communication. The goal is to create an environment of healthy communication based on truth and compassion, benefiting both the speaker and the listener, as it is essential for playing a significant role in the quality of our interactions.

It involves several dimensions:

- <ins>Refraining from lying</ins>: This means not deliberately speaking falsehoods, deceiving, or distorting the truth.
- <ins>Refraining from slander</ins>: Avoid speaking ill of others, spreading harmful rumors, or harming someone's reputation.
- <ins>Refraining from harsh or harmful words</ins>: Do not use coarse language, insults, or words that may hurt or inflict emotional suffering.

## Confucius's Trusted Disciple
One of the key principles of the thought and ethics of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. It seeks to emphasize the importance of reliability, loyalty, and ethics in interpersonal relationships and the pursuit of moral virtue. It reflects the emphasis on the importance of harmonious interpersonal relationships and the construction of a society based on morality and ethics.

Within the teachings, we should be someone who:

- <ins>Practices righteousness</ins>: Acts in accordance with ethical and moral principles, striving to do what is right in all situations.
- <ins>Demonstrates loyalty</ins>: Is loyal to their commitments, relationships, and responsibilities, showing fidelity to people and values they consider important.
- <ins>Maintains trust</ins>: Can be trusted to keep promises and hold secrets when necessary.
- <ins>Pursues moral virtue</ins>: Strives for continuous improvement and the cultivation of virtues such as compassion, honesty, and respect.
