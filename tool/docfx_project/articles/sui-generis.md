# Sui Generis
Since the public release of the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/), I've wanted to do something with it. However, my learning works better when I set a purpose beyond the infamous 'Hello World,' even though in many cases, that's enough.

## The Snap
The idea behind this proof of concept was meant to be the simplicity of the mechanics. That's when I came across the following [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7105852268574339073/) by [Marcelo Gaspar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgaspar1/) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/):

From this premise, I'd like to highlight two comments that served as the sparks guiding me in defining the library's purpose:

><i>"Very similar to Socrates' three sieves... I believe it uses the same basic principle. Makes total sense"</i>, [Alex Tavares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-tavares-620336164/).

><i>"Is it true? Is it good? Is it useful? An algorithm available for over two thousand years with various names like 'Socrates' Triple Filter,' 'Buddha's Right Speech,' 'Confucius' Trusted Disciple,' etc, etc. It's worth checking out the originals too ;-)"</i>, [Alisson Vale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alissonvale/), in [his share](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alissonvale_os-entendedores-entender%C3%A3o-l%C3%B3gica-simples-activity-7105895639296667648-Uvuh/) of Marcelo Gaspar's post.
 
In addition to the comment, Alisson added the article ["Socrates' Triple Filter Test"](https://www.weeklywisdomblog.com/post/socrates-triple-filter-test) by [Alex Chen](https://www.weeklywisdomblog.com/profile/alexchen373/profile), where the author discusses the topic.

## The Materialization
It was based on these philosophical guidelines that the **Lensophy (Lens + Philosophy)** was conceived: a tool for analyzing the intensity of communication and, when appropriate, suggesting a mild and friendly option, always promoting good communication.

Its simplicity can be illustrated as follows:

## Technically Speaking
As I mentioned at the beginning, the library's goal is not to be a reference, have commercial appeal, save sea turtles, or prevent deforestation in the Amazon. Devoid of ethical judgment and behavioral rules, the package is nothing more than an idea used for learning the OpenAI API.

><i>But anyone would be able to do this!</i>

Of course! And I'm <i>'anyone.'</i> That's why I did it. =)

Therefore, any and all contributions are welcome, whether it's about improving my code, suggestions for organization or advanced techniques, or simply ideas. Use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/raphaelmoreira/lensophy/wiki/I-%E2%80%90-Sui-Generis) for that. I read and respond to all.

I'd like to give an honorable mention to [Gabriel Guarnieri Cardoso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielgc/), who, even without knowing who I was, accepted my LinkedIn connection request and helped me understand how to communicate secrets (tokens) between GIT and a .Net application, which had me puzzled for hours. It was spot-on. Thank you.
