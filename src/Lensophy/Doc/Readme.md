# Introduction
This API provides developers with the ability to enhance their comment systems (such as forums, blogs, or websites) by analyzing, filtering, and encouraging good behavior through suggested responses that guide towards a friendly perspective rather than censoring it. 

An [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) is required to use it

# Getting Started
Installing the package.
```
dotnet add package Lensophy --version 0.0.0
```

In your `appSettings.json`, add the following configuration:

```
{
  "OpenAiConfig": {
    "Secret": "your OpenAi secret"
  }
}
```

In `Program.cs`, perform the following registration:

```
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

...
//code hidden for brevity.

builder.Services.AddHttpClient<LensophyService>(httpClient =>
{
    var secret = builder.Configuration.GetSection("openaiconfig:secret").Value;
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", secret);
});
```

In the `SampleController`, inject the dependency:
```
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class SampleController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly LensophyService _lensophyService;

    public SampleController(LensophyService lensophyService) => _lensophyService = lensophyService;
}
```

Call the `Analyse` routine at the desired endpoint.

```
[HttpPost(Name = "Analyse")]
public async Task<ContentAnalysed> Analyse([FromBody]ContentAnalyse contentToAnalyse)
{
    var contentAnalysed = await _lensophyService.AnalyseAsync(contentToAnalyse).ConfigureAwait(false);
    return contentAnalysed;
}
```
